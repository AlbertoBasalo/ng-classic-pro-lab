## 2023-11-16: Implemented real-time asset values

Added functionality to update asset values in real-time:

1. Created a new `AssetValueService` which retrieves current values for assets based on:
   - Category ID (Crypto, Real Estate, Commodities, Stocks, Cash)
   - Symbol (BTC, ETH, XAU, IBM, etc.)

2. Updated `AssetsRepositoryService.getAll$()` to use the new service:
   - Retrieves basic asset information from the source
   - For each asset, gets the current value from the appropriate repository
   - Uses RxJS operators (switchMap, forkJoin, map) to handle async operations
   - Includes error handling to maintain original values if retrievals fail
   
3. This implementation provides several benefits:
   - Assets now display current market values instead of static data
   - Modular design allows for easy extension to new asset types
   - Error handling ensures the application remains stable
   
Next steps:
- Consider adding caching mechanisms for frequently accessed values
- Implement automatic refresh for continuous value updates
- Add loading indicators for better UX during value retrieval

## 2023-11-16: Refactored asset value update logic

Improved code organization in `AssetsRepositoryService`:

1. Extracted asset update logic into a dedicated method `getUpdatedAssetValue$()`:
   - Makes the `getAll$()` method more concise and readable
   - Isolates value updating logic in a single, testable function
   - Provides clear documentation via JSDoc comments

2. Benefits of this refactoring:
   - Better code maintainability and readability
   - Improved testability with smaller, focused methods
   - Potential reuse of the update logic elsewhere in the codebase
   - Self-documenting code with clear method names
